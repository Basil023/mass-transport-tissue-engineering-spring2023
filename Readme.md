This repository provides teaching materials for the "Mass Transport in Tissue Engineering" sub-course that was taught in spring 2021. It includes Jupyter notebooks and Python code related to the topic. The content is designed to be used with Jupyter and Python, and an installation guide is provided in the repository. Alternatively, you can access an interactive online version using the provided binder badge.

The introductory notebooks in this repository are based on the "Lectures on scientific computing with Python" repository but have been modified to be compatible with Python 3. Additionally, there is a transient example obtained from a separate source.

Please note that an updated version of this repository for the fall 2021 semester is available [here](https://github.com/mbarzegary/mass-transport-tissue-engineering-fall2021).

For further information, you can watch the recorded hands-on session on YouTube, which is linked in the repository.
